Through one of the Reactor Ports, you'll pump in Deuterium, and through the other Port, you'll pump in Tritium. To start the Reactor, you'll have to place inside of its inventory, an Antimatter Filled Hohlraum. After that, you'll have to start a reaction to allow for heat to built up, and ultimately, to allow the Reactor to use its fuel and sustain itself.",

When around 1.5G RF is reached, you can fire the Amplifier at the reactor through its Laser Focus Matrix. This will make the Reactor reach its Ignition Temperature, which will start the reaction inside. After the reaction starts, the Reactor will start to produce more heat and power, based on the Fuel Injection rate which you can set in one of the menus available in the Reactor.",

 "ftbquests.chapter.useful_items_4.quests.69.description.8": "Now, considering the fact that this thing can output 50M RF/T, we think that a tiny explosion will not stop you from building it.",

 "ftbquests.chapter.useful_items_4.quests.69.description.12": "First, you place the Draconic Reactor Core where you want the center of your reactor to be. This is where the actual reaction will take place, and it will grow depending on the temperature and fuel you put in it. Next, you take 4 Reactor Stabilizers and place them in a ring around the core, the recommended distance being 5 blocks. They can be placed up to 6 blocks away, but must be in the same setup. They can also be placed vertically around the core. They must have a direct line-of-sight to the core when placed, otherwise they will not register.",
 "ftbquests.chapter.useful_items_4.quests.69.description.14": "Once you have the ring built, right click on any of the Stabilizers to bring up the Reactor GUI. If there is no GUI, you probably did something wrong.",
 "ftbquests.chapter.useful_items_4.quests.69.description.16": "If the GUI shows up, then, you can place the Energy Injector on one of the sides of the core that doesn't have a Reactor Stabilizer. This block is important, because it feeds RF back into the Reactor. Yes, the Reactor needs some RF to work properly and generate proper power amounts. Same as with the Stabilizers, the Injector can be placed at a maximum distance of 6 blocks between the Reactor Core and the Injector.",
 "ftbquests.chapter.useful_items_4.quests.69.description.18": "If the things are good, you should have something like this:",
 "ftbquests.chapter.useful_items_4.quests.69.description.22": "Now, assuming that you have fuel (Awakened Draconium), nothing should stop you from starting this Reactor, but we'd advice you to wait and prepare some safety measures. ",
 "ftbquests.chapter.useful_items_4.quests.69.description.24": "Let's talk about some technical safety measures. The Reactor doesn't have a concept of \\\"limits\\\", and will give or take as much RF as it can. This will create an unstable reactor, and eventually an explosion. It's a good idea to use a couple of Flux Gates, which limits how much RF/t can flow through it. It is also adjustable with a redstone signal, therefore it may be a good idea to place a Supplementaries Crank on each one. The Flux Gate is directional, with the side with the Blue Square being the input, and the side with the Orange Square being the output. Place one Flux Gate with its Blue side on the back of one of the Stabilizers, then place a second Flux Gate with its Orange side facing the bottom of the Energy Injector. This allows you to control how much RF/t is going out of and into the reactor, respectively.",
 "ftbquests.chapter.useful_items_4.quests.69.description.26": "Now, let's talk about the GUI of the Reactor:",
 "ftbquests.chapter.useful_items_4.quests.69.description.28": "Temperature: This is the Temperature of the Core. Keep this bellow 8000 and you should be ok.",
 "ftbquests.chapter.useful_items_4.quests.69.description.30": "Shield Strenght: This is the strenght of the shield preventing the reactor from exploding! You will want to find a nice balance for this. Too high and the Shield will consume more power then the Reactor can produce and it won't be able to self sustain its reaction. Too low and you risk an explosion.",
 "ftbquests.chapter.useful_items_4.quests.69.description.32": "Saturation: This is the energy stored in the Reactor's Core.",
 "ftbquests.chapter.useful_items_4.quests.69.description.34": "Fuel Conversion: This shows how much you have burned through your fuel. The higher the Core Temperature, the faster the Reactor will burn fuel. The fusion of Draconium will result into the Chaos Element. As the Level of Chaos within the Core increases, so does the reactivity of the Draconium. The higher the reactivity, the more energy will the Reactor produce. This means that, a reactor which was started with 8 Awakened Draconium Blocks, will initially produce small amounts of power, but as time passes and the Draconium is turned into Chaos, you'll produce much more power (and higher temperatures also). A quick tip is that, if you want to start producing more power from the beginning, you can start your reactor with 4 Awakened Draconium Blocks and 4 Chaos Shards in it. This will make the amount of Chaos even with the amount of Draconium and it will result in a hotter Reactor Core and in more RF outputs.",
 "ftbquests.chapter.useful_items_4.quests.69.description.36": "Now, a warning about Fuel in general. You CAN'T run a Reactor just with Chaos in it. Chaos needs Draconium in order to regulate itself. Without it, well.. you can imagine. Now, to refuel the Reactor, you MUST SHUT IT DOWN. Before doing this, make sure you have a significant backlog of power to supply the containment field while it shuts down. When you hit the 'Shutdown' button, the Reactor will immediately stop outputing power, and it will start the Shutdown process. This requires near 100% Saturation, thus allowing the generation rate to drop, which in term, allows the Temperature to drop. Once the Saturation passes around 99%, the Temperature will drop bellow 2000 degrees, fusion will cease and the Core will enter in the 'Cool Down' mode.",

Power will be provided to the Energy Injector which will, then, charge the Reactor.

 "ftbquests.chapter.useful_items_4.quests.69.description.54": "Online: This is the state in which the Reactor will produce the most amounts of power. You must maintain a balance between the amount of energy you supply the containment field and the amount of energy you extract. The more power you pull from the Reactor, the more the Reactor's Saturation will drop. The Reactor will compensate for this by incresing its generation rate to match the rate at which you're extracting power.",
 "ftbquests.chapter.useful_items_4.quests.69.description.56": "Cooling Down: This is the state where the Fusion was stopped and the reactor is Cooling Down.  At this point the containment field can shut down. Once the core cools sufficiently, you'll be able to refuel or dissmantle the Reactor. Even tho the Reactor is cooling down, it is still not safe break the Reactor unit. You should wait until the temperature is below 300 degrees. If you break the Reactor ar this point, there will be no explosion, but the result will also not be ideal.",
 "ftbquests.chapter.useful_items_4.quests.69.description.58": "Explosion Imminent: Usually, we'd tell you that, if you're seeing this, you should run. However, that will not be the case here.
