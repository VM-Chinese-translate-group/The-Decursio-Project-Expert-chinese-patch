This Generator has a higher RF/tick production then the Stirling and the Compression Dynamos, however, this higher RF/tick rate can be achieved only if the Generator's internal gas tank is full. It can consume just Hydrongen and Ethylene as fuels. Each one of them will produce different quantities of power, so let's see what numbers we're dealing with are.",

	"chapters.Gear_3.quests6.description7": "Keep in mind that the Gas-Burning Generator will be more useful for producing more RF/tick, and NOT more RF overall. Using the Compression Dynamo and 1 bucket of Refined Fuel, you can obtain 1.5M RF, while with the Gas-Burning Generator and 1 bucket of Ethylene, you can obtain only 313k RF. The advantage, however, comes with the higher RF/tick production rate. At its best, the Compression Dynamo will make 640RF/tick, while the Gas-Burning Generator, will make 2k RF/tick. See the differance?",
	"chapters.Gear_3.quests6.description8": "Also note that the Gas-Burning Generator will NOT produce 2k RF/tick if its internal gas tank is not full. So you'll need a setup that will produce enough Ethylene to keep that tank full. Don't worry, this will not be hard to achieve.",

Through one of the Reactor Ports, you'll pump in Deuterium, and through the other Port, you'll pump in Tritium. To start the Reactor, you'll have to place inside of its inventory, an Antimatter Filled Hohlraum. After that, you'll have to start a reaction to allow for heat to built up, and ultimately, to allow the Reactor to use its fuel and sustain itself.",

The Amplifier has to be set in a way which would not allow a laser beam to go through it. This way, the Amplifier will store the power coming from the Laser. When around 1.5G RF is reached, you can fire the Amplifier at the reactor through its Laser Focus Matrix. This will make the Reactor reach its Ignition Temperature, which will start the reaction inside. After the reaction starts, the Reactor will start to produce more heat and power, based on the Fuel Injection rate which you can set in one of the menus available in the Reactor.",

You don't want a Fusion Reactor to shut down because it takes a lot of time and energy to turn it on. Even if you're using the maximum amount of Lasers (5) to start this thing, it will take a long time to reach the 1.5G RF required for this thing to start running.",

This will create an unstable reactor, and eventually an explosion. It's a good idea to use a couple of Flux Gates, which limits how much RF/t can flow through it. It is also adjustable with a redstone signal, therefore it may be a good idea to place a Supplementaries Crank on each one. The Flux Gate is directional, with the side with the Blue Square being the input, and the side with the Orange Square being the output. Place one Flux Gate with its Blue side on the back of one of the Stabilizers, then place a second Flux Gate with its Orange side facing the bottom of the Energy Injector.

	"chapters.useful_items_4.quests70.description18": "Fuel Conversion: This shows how much you have burned through your fuel. The higher the Core Temperature, the faster the Reactor will burn fuel. The fusion of Draconium will result into the Chaos Element. As the Level of Chaos within the Core increases, so does the reactivity of the Draconium. The higher the reactivity, the more energy will the Reactor produce. This means that, a reactor which was started with 8 Awakened Draconium Blocks, will initially produce small amounts of power, but as time passes and the Draconium is turned into Chaos, you'll produce much more power (and higher temperatures also). A quick tip is that, if you want to start producing more power from the beginning, you can start your reactor with 4 Awakened Draconium Blocks and 4 Chaos Shards in it. This will make the amount of Chaos even with the amount of Draconium and it will result in a hotter Reactor Core and in more RF outputs.",

Without it, well.. you can imagine. Now, to refuel the Reactor, you MUST SHUT IT DOWN. Before doing this, make sure you have a significant backlog of power to supply the containment field while it shuts down. When you hit the 'Shutdown' button, the Reactor will immediately stop outputing power, and it will start the Shutdown process. This requires near 100% Saturation, thus allowing the generation rate to drop, which in term, allows the Temperature to drop. Once the Saturation passes around 99%, the Temperature will drop bellow 2000 degrees, fusion will cease and the Core will enter in the 'Cool Down' mode.",
