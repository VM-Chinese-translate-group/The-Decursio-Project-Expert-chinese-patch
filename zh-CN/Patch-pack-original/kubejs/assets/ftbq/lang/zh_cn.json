The Reactor doesn't have a concept of \\\"limits\\\", and will give or take as much RF as it can. This will create an unstable reactor, and eventually an explosion. It's a good idea to use a couple of Flux Gates, which limits how much RF/t can flow through it. It is also adjustable with a redstone signal, therefore it may be a good idea to place a Supplementaries Crank on each one. The Flux Gate is directional, with the side with the Blue Square being the input, and the side with the Orange Square being the output. Place one Flux Gate with its Blue side on the back of one of the Stabilizers, then place a second Flux Gate with its Orange side facing the bottom of the Energy Injector. This allows you to control how much RF/t is going out of and into the reactor, respectively.",

Too low and you risk an explosion.",

 "ftbquests.chapter.useful_items_4.quests.69.description.34": "Fuel Conversion: This shows how much you have burned through your fuel. The higher the Core Temperature, the faster the Reactor will burn fuel. The fusion of Draconium will result into the Chaos Element. As the Level of Chaos within the Core increases, so does the reactivity of the Draconium. The higher the reactivity, the more energy will the Reactor produce. This means that, a reactor which was started with 8 Awakened Draconium Blocks, will initially produce small amounts of power, but as time passes and the Draconium is turned into Chaos, you'll produce much more power (and higher temperatures also). A quick tip is that, if you want to start producing more power from the beginning, you can start your reactor with 4 Awakened Draconium Blocks and 4 Chaos Shards in it. This will make the amount of Chaos even with the amount of Draconium and it will result in a hotter Reactor Core and in more RF outputs.",
 "ftbquests.chapter.useful_items_4.quests.69.description.36": "Now, a warning about Fuel in general. You CAN'T run a Reactor just with Chaos in it. Chaos needs Draconium in order to regulate itself. Without it, well.. you can imagine. Now, to refuel the Reactor, you MUST SHUT IT DOWN. Before doing this, make sure you have a significant backlog of power to supply the containment field while it shuts down. When you hit the 'Shutdown' button, the Reactor will immediately stop outputing power, and it will start the Shutdown process. This requires near 100% Saturation, thus allowing the generation rate to drop, which in term, allows the Temperature to drop. Once the Saturation passes around 99%, the Temperature will drop bellow 2000 degrees, fusion will cease and the Core will enter in the 'Cool Down' mode.",
