				"Tinker's Construct allows players like you to create modular Tools which are, in many ways, better then the Vanilla Tool. These two Stations are a part of the mod and they're used to build Tool Part and assemble them into great Tools. Let's see how these work."
				""
				"First, if you haven't played with TC since 1.12, you should know that the Stencil Table was removed and now, it is integrated into the Part Builder. You'll only need blank Patterns."
				""
				"Now, if you haven't touched Tinker's Construct in your life, you should know that the Part Builder is used to turn materials into tool parts. A blank Pattern is placed in the left-hand side of the GUI. The material to be used is then place next to the pattern. This will show you a list of possible Tool Parts to craft. Choose one and then, take it out of the GUI."
				""
				"Now, you might find yourself in a situation where you select a Tool Part and nothing happens. That's most probably due to the fact that you don't have enough Material to make that Part. Yeah, that's right. Some Tool Parts, such as a Hammer Head, will require, for example, 8 pieces of Cobblestone. So make sure you have enough materials before starting to make your Tool."
				""
				"Example of the Part Builder GUI:"
				""
				"{image:kubejs:textures/tconstruct/part_builder_gui_example.png width:150 height:100 align:1 fit:true}"
				""
				"Notice how we're trying to make a Pickaxe Head with only 1 piece of Cobblestone. That's not gonna happen, as also stated by the information given on the right-hand side, we need 1 more piece of Cobblestone for a Pickaxe head. You can also see that, more information about the material we're using, is shown on the right-hand side. That information is related to all the possible parts we can make with that Material."
				""
				"Now, let's cover the Tinker Station. This is where you will assemble your Tool. Upon opening the GUI, you'll be greeted by a very nice interface. It might look a bit confusing in the beginning, but don't worry, we'll cover its main aspects."
				""
				"On the left-hand side, you'll be able to see a series of buttons. The first one is the upgrade tab, where you can place already existing Tools from Tinker's Construct, and upgrade them. All the other buttons represent tabs where you can assemble Tools. Unfortunately, the Tinker Station will NOT allow you to assemble all the Tools available in the mod, so, for now, you'll have to wait until the 2nd Age for more advanced Tools. "
				""
				"Selecting one of the Tools, will show you, on the right-hand side, all of the Parts required to assemble it, along with a general description of the Tool and what it does. Place your Parts in their respective slots, and your Tool will be ready for work."

Upon clicking on it, a planning menu will be opened. Here you can play around with certain Tools, Materials, Upgrades and Abilities to create the ultimate Tool. You can also bookmark it and have it saved, so you can build it later."

			description: [
				"The Smeltery is a multi-block structure used in the creation of higher-tier weapons and tools using metal and alloys. It is used to smelt ores, ingots or blocks of almost any metal as well as Obsidian."
				""
				"Begin construction by placing a 3x3 base of Seared Bricks. Typical Smeltery construction has the base laid into the ground rather than on top of the ground. "
				""
				"Add walls one layer above the Smeltery base in a 5x5 perimeter. The corners are not necessary for the functioning of the smeltery and may be left out. Any blocks placed in these corners will not count as a component of the Smeltery."
				""
				"To complete the Smeltery, replace two of the wall blocks with a Seared Tank and a Smeltery Controller. The Smeltery Controller should begin glowing, indicating successful Smeltery construction. Right-clicking the Smeltery Controller will allow you to access the Smeltery GUI. Note that you can only have one Smeltery Controller in a smeltery."
				""
				"You can continue to add layers to your Smeltery walls. Every layer that you add will give you an additional 9 processing slots (9 slots for each 3x3 space inside the smeltery). The smeltery walls can be constructed out of any variety of Seared Brick, Seared Glass, or Seared Windows."
				""
				"You will also need to add Smeltery Drains and Faucets to your Smeltery. When you place a Smeltery Drain, it does not matter which side the hole faces. If your Smeltery is a 5x5 with no corners, you cannot place the drain in the empty corners; it must be placed in one of the walls. You can place the drains at any level up and down the Smeltery; however, keep in mind that they will require a Casting Basin or Casting Table placed directly underneath the faucet to work."
				""
				"How to Use:"
				""
				"To use the Smeltery, you must first add some lava to the Seared Tank, Seared Window, or Seared Glass (Either manually by right-clicking with a bucket of Lava. This will heat up the interior of the Smeltery to allow you to process materials. Once your Smeltery has some lava powering it, right-click on the Smeltery Controller to bring up its GUI."
				""
				"The left side of the GUI shows your processing slots, with 9 slots added for every layer of empty space inside your smeltery."
				""
				"The middle of the GUI is the storage tank where the liquid metals are stored. This allows you to see how much liquid metal is inside the Smeltery, what kinds of metal, and in what order they will be drained (starting from the bottom). You CAN CHANGE the order by clicking on the desired liquid."
				""
				"The bar along the right side of the GUI is how much lava the Smeltery currently has left. Having less lava means the ores heat up slower. No lava prevents any smelting from occurring. "
				""
				"To use the liquid metal, you must drain the liquid into a Casting Basin or a Casting Table. Place a Seared Faucet onto the small hole on a Smeltery Drain, and place a Casting Basin or Casting Table underneath the drain. To activate the Faucet, right-click on it. A Casting Basin will allow you to create blocks. Metal blocks require 9 ingots, but other smeltable materials, like Obsidian or Glass and Sand, require the same amount of material that was placed into the smeltery. The Casting Table will allow you to create casts out of Gold to create other metal items using the casts you have previously made."

				"The Clay Vessel has mainly two uses. It can either be cooked to obtain a solid Container, or it can be used to smelt soft ores, such as Lead and Gold. It can even be used to make Bronze."

If you let it cool, or don't pump the Bellows enough, it will fail and you will have to start over. Don't worry about loosing your resources if the smelting process fails.

				"These three items will allow you to access liquid manipulation early in the game, so let's cover each one of them."
				""
				"The Ceramic Cistern can be used as a Liquid Tank, but only for Cool Liquids, such as Water, Milk, Vinegar, etc. It can also store Hot Liquids, such as Lava, but it will take constant damage over time, until it breaks and all of its contents will be placed in world. It is also not portable and it will loose all of its contents when picked up. Cracked Cisterns can also be picked up. They'll be damaged and fixed in your Crafting Grid with some Clay."
				""
				"A Cistern can hold 4 Buckets of liquid. It can also be vertically extended with more Cirsterns. This works only with Cisterns of the same color, so, for example, an Orange Cistern CANNOT extend a Green Cistern. You can use this behavior in your advantage."
				""
				"Now, let's talk about Faucets. These can be used to extract liquids from Cisterns and other Drains, for example, those present in Tinker's Construct. When it's connected to a Cistern, it can extract the liquid present in it by simply right-clicking it. It can also receive a Redstone Signal to output fluids automatically. Faucets can be placed anywhere on a Cistern. The amount of fluid present, won't interfere with the position of the Faucet."
				""
				"Finally, let's talk about Channels. If you're familiar with Tinker's Construct, these are exactly like the Seared, or the Scorched Channels present there, with the exception of not being able to transport hot fluids without taking damage."
				""
				"However, if you're not familiar with Tinker's Construct, know that these things are used to transport liquids around. They can also insert liquids into other Cisterns, or other 'machines' or working stations, but they CANNOT be used to extract from them. In this case, they have to be used in combination with a Faucet."
				""
				"Example of a Faucet-Channel Combo:"
				""
				"{image:kubejs:textures/ceramics/channel_faucet_example.png width:100 height:100 align:1}"
				""
				"Channels are a bit tricky to handle as they'll often not allow liquids to flow properly and you'll have no idea why is that happening. The answear is quite simple. You can adjust their flowing direction by Right-Clicking, or Shift Right-Clicking, depending on which side you wish to configure. Their texture will help you figure out in which way they'll allow liquids to pass, as they have some little 'arrows' drawn on them."
				""
				"Example of two Channels flowing in opposite directions:"
				""
				"{image:kubejs:textures/ceramics/channel_flowing_example.png width:100 height:100 align:1}"
				""
				"In the example shown above, the Channel on the right side will allow liquids to go back, while the Channel on the left side will allow liquids to go forward."
				""
				"With Right-Click you can even disconnect them from pretty much anything, including themselves."
				""
				"Liquids can even be transported downwards. By placing Channels over each other, you can configure them (by Right-Clicking from bellow) to transfer their contents from the one located above, to the one located below."
				""
				"Example of two Channels ready to flow into each other:"
				""
				"{image:kubejs:textures/ceramics/channel_down_example.png width:100 height:100 align:1}"
				""
				"Notice how the Channel present above has a small opening which will allow liquids to flow down."
				""
				"Finally, we want to show you a small setup which will take water from a Cistern and place it in a Wooden Basin:"
				""
				"{image:kubejs:textures/ceramics/channel_full_setup_example.png width:160 height:100 align:1}"
				""
				"Notice how all the tiny 'arrows' on the Channels are pointing towards the Wooden Basin."
				""
				"Channels can also make turns to right or left, but unfortunately, they cannot go upwards."

				"Tinker's Construct is a mod focused around modularity. This means that most of your gear can be upgraded/augmented/modified to suit your needs."
				""
				"Now, we'd suggest checking the 'Encyclopedia of Tinkering' to fully understand Tinker's Construct and all of it's features, but we'll also try to briefly explain some of the upgrade mechanics."
				""
				"Tinkers Construct has mainly 2 types of modifications. These include Upgrades and Abilities. Upgrades are modifications which usually boost the stats already present on a Tool. Abilities are modifiers which provide unique traits to your Tools; think of them as Enchantments. These can allow you to Dual Wield Weapons, Breath Underwater and more."
				""
				"Each Tool/Piece of Equipment added by this mod has a limited total number of Upgrade and Ability slots. The number of available Upgrades and Abilities can be increased through certain ways. These include &aDragon Heads, Music Disks, Skulls, End Crystals, Book and Quill&r and they have to be applied to your Tool/Armor at a Tinker's Station, or a Tinker's Anvil."
				""
				"The Upgrades and Abilities previously mentioned, are further organized in more categories:"
				""
				"- General: These are Upgrades/Abilities which are effective on multiple types of tools, including Melee Weapons, Harvest Tools, along with Armor. There are also some Upgrades/Abilities which are only available to Melee Weapons and Havest Tools, so make sure to check JEI and the Encyclopedia of Tinkering to find out more."
				""
				"- Weapon: These are Upgrades/Abilities that are most effective on Melee Weapons, whether it is a Sword, or a repurposed Harvest Tool. Many of these upgrades can also be applied to Chestplates, but there's a catch. That Chestplate needs the 'Unarmed' Ability."
				""
				"- Harvest: These are Upgrades/Abilities that are effective mostly on Harvest Tools, such as Pickaxes, Axes and more."
				""
				"- Armor: These are Upgrades/Abilities which are typically effective on a single type of Armor or are desinged to run on counter attacks. These mainly include things like Aqua Affinity, Double Jump, Zoom and more."
				""
				"Finally, we've covered the Upgrades and the Abilities. Now, let's cover the Defense Upgrades. These are special Upgrades dedicated to Armor Pieces. They include things such as Dedicated Protection, for example, Blast Protection, Knockback Resistance, Gold for walking past Piglins, and more. Note that more Defense Slots CANNOT be added, so you'll have to change the type of Armor you want to use, as each set of Armor added by Tinker's Construct has different amounts of slots."
				""
				"Oh, and one more word of advice. If you're interested in upgrading your Armor with general Protection, then you have to use a Diamond which, luckly, is considered to be a General Upgrade."
