				"Green - Here you'll fing the Notebook menu, the Color Picker Menu and the Familiars menu. The Notebook menu will open the Worn Notebook which is Ars Nouveau's guide book. The Color Picker menu is where you'll be able to choose the color of the spells you'll cast. The Familiar menu is where you'll be able to summon your current Familiars (find more about familiars in the 'Tablet of Binding' quest)."
				""
				"Yellow - Here you'll find your Glyphs. Think of them as spell components. There are 3 types of Glyphs: Form, Augment and Effect. The Form is the way a spell will be casted. The Effect is the outcome of a spell being casted and the Augment is bonuses/modifications of the previously mentioned Forms and Effects. When you open the Spell Book for the first time, some Glyphs will be available to you, but not all of them. To obtain more, you'll have to craft them and right-click them. Note that Glyphs are organized in 3 Tiers. For each Tier, you'll need the proper Spell Book. This Novice Spell Book will allow you to access only Tier 1 Glyphs. So. You want better Spells? Make a better Spell Book. Higher Tier Spell Books will also allow you to use lower Tier Glyps."
				""
				"Aqua - Here's the Spell crafting field. Here you'll desing your Spells. To create a spell, you'll have to add Glyphs available above by left-clicking them. Each Spell must start with a Form Glyph. After that, you can add either an Effect Glyph, or combinations of Augment and Effect Glyphs. Each Spell can have a maximum amount of 10 Glyphs."
				""
				"Light Blue - Here you can name your Spell, save your Spell and clear the Spell crafting field."
				""
				"Magenta - Here you can seach through your available Glyphs."
				""
				"Red - Here you can select your saved Spells. Each Spell Book can have a maximum amount of 10 saved Spells."
				""
				"After creating a Spell, you can cast it by simply right-clicking the Spell Book. "
				""
				"Now, since Ars Nouveau has the ability to create very powerful Spells, there has to be a catch in using them. While holding the Spell Book in your hand, you might've noticed that a fancy magenta bar appears on your screen. That's you mana bar. Things are simple. The more potent your Spells are, the more mana will be consumed. Mana does regenerate on its own and there will be various means to increase the amount of mana you have and its regen rate, but for now, get used to what you have."
				""
				"Lastly note that after creating your first Spell, you'll have to use the Open Spell Book key (bind it in your controls menu) to open the Spell Book again."
